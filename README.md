# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM (StockPredictLSTM)

## Project Overview
StockPredictLSTM is a web application designed to predict stock prices using advanced deep learning techniques. The core predictive model uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting.

The project integrates:
- **Frontend:** Developed using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend:** Built with **Flask**, serving as an API layer to connect the frontend with the deep learning model.
- **Deep Learning Model:** LSTM model implemented in Python to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

## Features
- Dynamic and responsive UI for stock price visualization.
- Real-time predictions using LSTM-based deep learning.
- Backend API integration for smooth data flow between frontend and model.
- Use of modern web technologies ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## My Contributions
This fork focuses on my significant contributions during the project, including:

- **Deep Learning Model Development:**  
  Designed, implemented, and trained the LSTM model for accurate stock price prediction. Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization.

- **Backend Integration:**  
  Developed the backend server using **Flask** to integrate the LSTM model with the frontend application. Created API endpoints for sending prediction requests and receiving model outputs.

- **Collaboration and Code Management:**  
  Actively collaborated using Git for version control, maintaining clean, modular, and well-documented code.

- **Testing and Validation:**  
  Conducted extensive testing of the backend APIs and model predictions to ensure reliability and correctness.
